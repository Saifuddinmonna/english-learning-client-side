					What are the origin od english language?
				</h3>

				<p className=" border rounded shadow p-3 m-3">
					n many ways, the history of the English language is the
					history of the British Isles. Every invading and occupying
					person left its mark on the English language. English is a
					Germanic language that includes influences from Greek and
					Roman, with a healthy dose of French thrown in. There is
					also a smattering of Dutch and Norse influence and even a
					little bit of Urdu. Like many other languages, English
					borrows words from other languages. But, unlike many other
					languages, English preserves the spelling patterns and the
					pronunciations of words it borrows from other languages.

					walk quickly, a very tired puppy. However, there's more to
					it than just those four word classes. English is unique in a
					couple of ways. First, English speakers sometimes create new
